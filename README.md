## Features

#### WASD Browsing

You can use WASD or the up/down arrows to insta-scroll to the next song in the list. This may seem trivial but give it a shot - you can basically fly through the list without moving your eyes.

#### Difficulty Filters

You can hide any songs that don't include at least one of the difficulties you've selected.

#### Draggable Menu

You can click and drag the menu at anytime in case it's getting in the way.

#### Hiding Songs by Certain Mappers

If you're tired of scrolling through the newest incomplete test versions of maps I have good news. You can hide all aongs by any mapper uploading their test maps by clicking the "Hide Mapper" button next to their name. You can bring back their songs at any time by clicking their name in the "Restore Mappers" section of the widget.

#### Hiding Duplicate Maps by the same Mapper

Have you ever seen the same song uploaded twice by the same Mapper? If you have, you may have noticed the newer version is pretty much always the one you want. So this widget automatically hides any older duplicate songs by an individual mapper. What if two mappers happen to do the same song? Both songs will still appear. The widget only hides duplicates with the same author.
