### Don't read me.

Aww geez... what did I _just_ say?

# Installation

After installing a userscript browser extension/add-on (such as [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome or [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for FireFox) visit this link: [https://openuserjs.org/scripts/TedCart/BeastSaberFilterHelper](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/TedCart/BeastSaberFilterHelper)

Then just click "install."

This script currently only works on the "Newest Songs" page and the "Curator Recommended" page of [bsaber.com](bsaber.com).

## Features

#### Activate/Deactivate Filters

The basic on/off button for all your filters. Helpful if you just want to see the full song list again without adjusting individual settings.

#### Difficulty Filters

Hides any songs that don't include at least one of the difficulties you've selected.

#### Hide Songs by Certain Mappers

If you're tired of scrolling through the newest incomplete test versions of maps I have good news: You can hide all songs by any mapper uploading their test maps by clicking the "Hide Mapper" button next to their name. You can bring back their songs at any time by clicking their name in the "Restore Mappers" section of the widget.

#### WASD Insta-Scroll

You can use WASD or the up/down arrows to insta-scroll to the next song in the list. It seems trivial but give it a shot - you can basically fly through the list without moving your eyes.

#### Draggable Menu

Click and drag the menu box at anytime if it's in the way.

#### Hiding Duplicate Maps by the same Mapper

Have you ever seen the same song uploaded twice by the same mapper? If you have, you may have noticed the newer version is pretty much always the one you want. This widget automatically hides any older duplicate songs by an individual mapper.

What if two mappers happen to do the same song? Both songs will still appear. The widget only hides duplicates by the same mapper.

#### Reminder:

##### All hidden posts can be revealed at anytime by clicking "Deactivate Filters" at the top of the menu.
